Level 0 -
	Connect to the server at bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org with the
	password bandit0. Once connected, use cat to print the contents of the
	readme file.

Level 1 -
	Connect to the server then use the command cat ./- to print out the file
	named -. Without the prefix ./ the cat command runs on your terminal instead
	of the file you attempted to specify.

Level 2 -
	Cat out the file name "spaces in this filename" by either using quotes
	around the file name of backslashes in front of the spaces to escape them so
	they arent processed as special characters

Level 3 -
	Change directory into the "inhere" folder and use ls -A to print a list of
	all file/subdirectories including ones that start with a . ("hidden files")
	The run cat .hidden to print out the file.

Level 4 -
	Change directory into the "inhere" folder the run the file command to see
	the type of file. Pass it ./\-* using the * wildflag to select all files.
	Then cat out the file that contains "ASCII text" which is a human readable
	format.

Level 5 -
	Change directory into "inhere". Use the find command with the -size flag to
	specify the filesize. Pass it "1033c" to indicate 1033 bytes then cat out
	the contents removing whitespace.

Level 6 -
	The clue "somewhere on the server" indicated to move to the root directory
	by doing cd /;. Then use the find command with the directory . Specify the
	-group bandit6, -user bandit7, and -size 33c. Then add 2>/dev/null to hide
	warning and cat out the resulted file.

Level 7 -
	Use the grep command with the -P flag to access 'pearl grep' (the full grep
	library) and use a "positive lookbehind" (?<=word) to find text after a
	specific word, in this case "millionth" and then capture all character after
	it but before a linebreak, .*

Level 8 -
	Sort the contents of data.txt then pipe that into uniq with the -u flag to
	only return unique lines. (Explaination: uniq only checks adjacent lines so
	they need to be sorted before it is effective)

Level 9 -
	Use strings on data.txt to print the readable contents of the file. Pipe
	that into grep finding a startline (^) and 4 or more equal signs (={4,})
	then any characters (.*).

Level 10 -
	Use the base64 command with the -d flag to indicate decoding and pass the
	file data.txt
